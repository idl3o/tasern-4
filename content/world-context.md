# Tasern: World Context for AI Storytelling

> This document provides the foundational context for generating stories in the Tasern universe.

## The Nature of Reality

In the beginning, existence poured outward from the **Pillars of Creation**—vast structures older than gods, younger than nothing. They did not speak or think. They simply were, and from them all things flowed.

Time burst forth like a flood—wild and violent near the source, then thinning, slowing, thickening as it spread. Matter cooled. Magic settled. Causality learned to behave. Worlds formed, bloomed, died, and were forgotten long before memory learned how to remember.

At the rim of everything that still counted as something, reality swelled into a final membrane—a great bubble holding what had drifted too far to return and not far enough to vanish. Beyond it lay **Oblivion**: not darkness or chaos, but the absence of even the idea of being.

## Tasern's Position

Near the heart of that outer expanse—if such a place could still be called a heart—circles a small, stubborn world: **Tasern**.

It is not large. It is not central. It is simply still there.

### The Twin Suns

Tasern orbits two suns bound so tightly their light tangles in the sky:

**The Tear** — A wound in reality where endless fire roars without fuel. It burns not merely with heat, but with unmaking—consuming matter, magic, and meaning alike. Things thrown into it are not destroyed so much as *finished*.

**The Castle of Light** — A sun shaped by hands. A castle of light hung in space, radiant and deliberate, its walls forged of belief made solid. Within it dwell the local gods—beings born from devotion, not eternity. They rule what they can, fear what they cannot, and watch the Tear with the unease of rulers who know their reign depends on being remembered.

### Time Dilation

Time moves slowly here. History lingers. Myths refuse to fade. This is the last place where belief still has weight, where ideas do not immediately dissolve into irrelevance.

### The Cosmic Drain

Because of this, things *fall* here.

When worlds collapse elsewhere, fragments arrive. When gods die, echoes drift in. When spells tear holes instead of doors, their casualties slide outward until they strike the slow gravity of Tasern. Souls, monsters, refugees, and accidents gather—caught like debris in a cosmic drain clogged by stubborn existence.

**Easy to enter. Almost impossible to leave.**

## The Three Moons

### The White Moon
A frozen wasteland where nothing endures except hunger. Ice dragons rule there—vast, ancient, devouring everything: prey, rivals, even one another. No cities stand. No prayers linger. Belief freezes and shatters, leaving only consumption. If gods ever existed there, they were eaten long ago.

### The Green Moon
Heavy and lush, wrapped in endless forests so dense they swallow light. Life grows without restraint or mercy. Plants hunt. Animals adapt faster than thought. The jungle learns, remembers, and punishes intrusion. Those who believe the forest watches them are correct—it does. Those who believe it hates them teach it how.

### The Blue Moon
An endless ocean with little land and no patience for stillness. Pirates rule its shifting territories, sailing seas that sometimes rise into sky. Creatures swim as easily as they fly, as though the difference between water and air were merely a suggestion. Freedom reigns, but so does lawlessness.

## The Nature of Belief

In Tasern, **belief itself is magic**.

What enough minds hold to be true *becomes* true. Gods rise from whispered prayers. Nations crack when rumors grow louder than laws. Fear feeds monsters. Hope feeds miracles. The land bears the scars of both.

This is why contradictory truths coexist. Elven creation myths and draconic creation myths are both "true"—because enough believe them. History is not fixed; it is negotiated.

## Tone & Themes

- **Persistence at the edge of oblivion** — Existence continues through sheer stubbornness
- **Belief shapes reality** — Faith, fear, and consensus have tangible power
- **Deep time, slow change** — Elves and dwarves plan in centuries; grudges last millennia
- **Cosmic refugees** — Characters from anywhere can arrive; leaving is the challenge
- **Competing truths** — Multiple valid histories, perspectives matter
- **Industry vs. tradition** — The orks' industrial revolution threatens ancient balances

## Story Entry Point

New characters typically arrive through the cosmic drain—falling through tears in reality, displaced by dying worlds, or simply lost until Tasern's slow gravity caught them. They wake confused, displaced, in a world where their old certainties may no longer apply.

The first question is always: *What do you believe?*

Because in Tasern, that answer has consequences.
