# Geography of Tasern

> An Earth-sized world of scattered continents, patient oceans, and lands arranged to keep people apart just long enough for their beliefs to grow sharp.

---

## The Oceans

Vast, patient waters stretch between lands—not hostile, not kind, simply there. Ships cross for months without sight of shore, guided by stars that sometimes shift when sailors argue too fiercely about where they are going.

Storms move slowly here. They gather, circle, linger, and only depart once they feel acknowledged. Many captains speak to them as equals. Some storms listen.

## Tern (Main Continent)

The largest continent and the one most travelers believe to be the world entire—until it proves otherwise. A long, uneven mass of plains, forests, mountains, and scars. No single people have ever held it all, though many have tried.

### West Wood
An ancient forest whose trees grow wide rather than tall, roots knotted together beneath soil like clasped hands. Light filters through reluctantly. Travelers feel watched—not by eyes, but by memory. Paths change when spoken about too confidently. Those who enter with grand plans sometimes walk in circles until they learn humility.

### Skrim (North)
Cold lands where stone cities cling to plateaus and high plains like stubborn thoughts refusing to be worn down. Harsh but deliberate life. Endurance is a virtue that shapes the soul—and so the land shapes them in return. Winters linger. Crops grow lean. Children learn early that survival is prayer.

### Argenti (East)
Mountains folded upward, pale with silver veins and sheer cliffs carved into stacked cities. Bells ring constantly—not for worship, but for study. Scholars test faith the way alchemists test metals. Sometimes the mountains answer. Sometimes they collapse. *Home of the Dwarves.*

### Manlan (South)
Heat softens stone and certainty alike. Broken coastline dotted with ports that welcome strangers and watch them carefully. People go south to disappear, reinvent themselves, or chase rumors that the edge of the world is closer there. *Heart of the Durgan Dynasty.*

### Elpha (Central)
Broad and fertile, rivers winding like patient arguments through fields of grain. Belief here is practical. Gods of harvest and boundary stones flourish. Contracts matter. Borders are defended not by walls alone, but by shared agreement they exist. *Home of the Elves.*

### Orklin (Threaded through Tern)
Badlands of black stone, volcanic scars, and ash-choked valleys wound through the land like an old scar. Orc clans rule here, bound by oaths older than most written history. Strength is respected, memory is feared. Every insult remembered. Every favor recorded. Outsiders see chaos. The clans see balance. *Home of the Orks—now industrializing.*

## Isles of a Thousand Kingdoms

An archipelago so dense with islands that no map survives a single generation. Each island believes itself unique, and so it is.

Kings rule by divine right until their gods are forgotten. Councils govern until consensus fractures. Some islands worship ideas. Others worship silence. The sea between them is crowded with ships, spies, and prophets fleeing yesterday's truths.

*Shaped and ruled by the Pirates.*

---

## Greyhills

Rolling highlands and deep inland waters where earth rises and falls like slow breathing. Ruins dot the hills—stonework too old to match any living culture.

**Redspire**: A peak stained crimson by something no scholar agrees upon. Some claim it bleeds. Others say it remembers a fire that never went out. Few climb it. Fewer return unchanged.

---

## Lanice (Far North)

Ice locks this continent in long, grinding seasons. Mountains encircle its heart, isolating peoples who survive without expecting help. Trade cities cling to thawing coasts—hard-eyed and harder-hearted.

Many believe Lanice was once closer to the White Moon, and that some part of it still is. The cold there feels personal.

---

## The White Wastes (Beyond Lanice)

Permanent ice. Expeditions vanish into silence. Those who return speak less each time, as though words themselves froze on the way back.

---

## Londa (South of Tern)

Small in land, immense in influence. Neutral ports thrive alongside markets that sell information the way others sell grain. Assassins drink beside diplomats. Everyone listens.

Londa survives by knowing who believes what—and when that belief is about to change.

---

## Cubek (Far South)

Vast continent of salt flats, sinkholes, and shallow seas that come and go like mirages. Nomads cross it guided by stars and expectation.

Cities appear where enough people believe they will. Some stay after belief fades. Others collapse overnight. Outsiders call it cursed. Its people say the land merely refuses to lie.

---

## Stralia (Southeast)

Green swallows stone. Jungles climb mountains. Buildings are grown rather than built. Beasts live alongside people—not as pets, but as partners shaped by shared survival.

The Green Moon looms large in their myths. Sometimes, when the jungle listens closely enough, the moon seems to answer.

---

## The Desert of Igypt

Weeks of empty, unbroken desert in every direction. Deliberate isolation enforced by heat, sand, and belief. At its heart rises the city of Igypt—towers of stone and gold above necropolises older than most nations.

*See: Igypt faction.*

## Celestial Geography

### The Twin Suns
- **The Tear**: A wound in reality. Endless fire. Unmaking.
- **The Castle of Light**: A sun-castle where local gods dwell.

### The Three Moons
- **White Moon**: Frozen. Ice dragons. Hunger.
- **Green Moon**: Jungle. Life without restraint.
- **Blue Moon**: Ocean. Pirates. Freedom and chaos.

### The Void Between
Open space—quiet, calm, uncaring. No storms, no monsters, no malice. Simply no air. Ships drift. Creatures swim the void. Ruins pass silently between stars. Travel is possible through magic, madness, or accident.

## Navigation Notes

- Stars sometimes shift when sailors argue about direction
- Maps of the Thousand Kingdoms expire within a generation
- Paths in the West Wood change when discussed confidently
- Cities in Cubek appear and vanish based on collective belief
- The desert around Igypt enforces isolation through belief as much as sand
