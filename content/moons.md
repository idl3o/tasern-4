# The Three Moons of Tasern

> Each moon is a world unto itself, watching Tasern from above, shaping myths and occasionally answering prayers.

---

## The White Moon

**Theme**: Hunger, consumption, the death of belief

A frozen wasteland where nothing endures except hunger.

### Inhabitants
**Ice Dragons** rule the White Moon—vast, ancient, and endlessly devouring. They consume everything they encounter: prey, rivals, even one another. There is no society. No cooperation. No restraint.

### Environment
- Permanent ice and cold beyond survival
- No cities stand upon its surface
- No prayers linger
- Belief itself freezes and shatters here

### Mythology
It is said that if gods ever existed on the White Moon, they were eaten long ago. The moon represents what happens when consumption becomes the only value—when even belief cannot sustain itself against pure appetite.

### Connection to Tasern
- Lanice (the ice-locked northern continent) may have once been closer to the White Moon
- Some believe part of Lanice still is—the cold there feels personal
- Ice dragon influence occasionally extends to Tasern's polar regions

## The Green Moon

**Theme**: Life without restraint, growth as threat, nature that remembers

Heavy and lush, wrapped in endless forests so dense they swallow light.

### Environment
- Life grows without restraint or mercy
- Plants hunt
- Animals adapt faster than thought
- The jungle learns, remembers, and punishes intrusion

### The Watching Forest
Those who believe the forest watches them are correct—it does.

Those who believe it hates them *teach it how*.

This is the danger of the Green Moon: belief shapes it even more directly than Tasern. Fear becomes predator. Respect becomes safety. Contempt becomes doom.

### Mythology
The Green Moon represents creation run wild—life fed by belief but stripped of meaning. Growth for its own sake. Evolution without purpose. Nature that has forgotten why it creates, only that it must.

### Connection to Tasern
- Stralia (the southeastern jungle continent) has strong mythological ties
- When the jungle of Stralia listens closely enough, the Green Moon sometimes answers
- Druids of the Living Cycle may draw power from or answer to the Green Moon's influence

## The Blue Moon

**Theme**: Freedom, chaos, the dissolution of boundaries

An endless ocean with little land and no patience for stillness.

### Inhabitants
**Pirates** rule the shifting territories—sailing seas that sometimes rise into sky. This is not metaphor. The distinction between water and air is treated as suggestion rather than law.

### Environment
- Endless ocean with scattered, temporary land
- Creatures swim as easily as they fly
- Boundaries dissolve—between sea and sky, between law and chaos
- Freedom reigns, but so does lawlessness

### Mythology
The Blue Moon represents what happens when all constraints are removed. Pure freedom—exhilarating and dangerous. Those who linger too long often forget where the sea ends and the heavens begin. Identity itself becomes fluid.

### Connection to Tasern
- The Pirates of the Thousand Kingdoms have cultural and possibly literal ties to the Blue Moon
- Some pirate vessels may travel between the Blue Moon and Tasern's seas
- The archipelago's chaotic nature may reflect Blue Moon influence

## Lunar Cycles & Influence

The three moons watch Tasern in turn, and their positions affect the world below:

| Moon | Dominant Influence | Effect on Tasern |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| White Moon ascendant | Hunger, cold, consumption | Harsh winters, predator activity increases, scarcity |
| Green Moon ascendant | Growth, adaptation, wildness | Crops flourish or overgrow, beasts more active, jungles expand |
| Blue Moon ascendant | Freedom, chaos, fluidity | Seas rise, boundaries weaken, pirates embolden |

When multiple moons align, their influences combine in unpredictable ways.

## Travel Between Worlds

The space between Tasern and its moons is the Void—quiet, calm, uncaring. It holds no storms, no monsters, no malice. It simply lacks air.

Through magic, madness, or accident, things sometimes cross it:
- Ships drift between worlds
- Creatures swim the void
- Ruins pass silently between stars

The bubble of existence does not forbid travel—it merely offers no help.

- Ice dragon refugees fled the White Moon's endless hunger
- A druid seeks to understand why the Green Moon answers Stralia's jungle
- Pirates speak of routes between the Blue Moon's seas and Tasern's oceans
- Something on the White Moon is no longer eating—and that terrifies the ice dragons
