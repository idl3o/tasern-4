# The Factions of Tasern

> Eight powers shape the world. Each mints its own currency. Each believes its own truth.

---

## 1. The Elves of Elpha
**Currency**: Elven Gold Piece ($EGP)
**Region**: Elpha (fertile heartland of Tern)
**Lifespan**: ~1,000 years

The elves do not hurry, and because of that, their lands endure.

An elf might live a thousand years, and most plan as though they expect to see every one of them. Forest borders are decided centuries before the first tree is cut. Roads are laid where future rivers are predicted to wander. Wars are entered only after generations of debate, and once begun, are prosecuted with a patience that breaks shorter-lived enemies long before blades do.

**Strengths**: Finest enchanted works in the world—blades that remember every battle, rings that age alongside their wearers, tools that grow more precise with use.

**Alliances**: Trade with the Durgan Dynasty. Respect dwarven craft.

**Enemies**: Distrust dragons (whose power burns too quickly). Ancient war with the Orks of Orklin—fought slowly, deliberately, and without expectation of forgiveness.

**Culture**: Art is never rushed. Wine is not bottled until it has forgotten the hands that made it. Magic is craft, not miracle.

## 2. The Dwarves of Argenti
**Currency**: Unknown (trade partners, not currency issuers)
**Region**: Argenti (silver mountains east of Elpha)
**Lifespan**: ~1,000 years

The dwarves do not gather in crowds, and they do not explain themselves.

They live alone or in small, deliberate households carved deep into pale mountains, separated by leagues of stone and centuries of silence. A dwarf might pass decades without speaking to another soul and consider it a productive season.

**Philosophy**: Anything worth making should outlast its maker. A dwarven blade is not finished when it is sharp, but when it no longer remembers being forged.

**Exports**: Siege engines that never warp, walls that refuse to crumble, armor that ages better than its wearer. Engineers and masons hired for a century at a time.

**Trade Partners**: Durgan Dynasty and Igypt.

**Goal**: Not glory. Permanence. In a world close to ending, that is power enough.

## 3. The Durgan Dynasty (Humans)
**Currency**: Durgan Dynasty Doubloon ($DDD)
**Region**: Manlan (southern coast of Tern)
**Lifespan**: ~80 years
**Dynasty Age**: 500 years unbroken

The Durgan Dynasty did not rise through conquest, but through connection.

Humans, brief-lived by elven and dwarven measure, compensate with speed and adaptability. Where others plan for centuries, Durgan plans for generations—and acts immediately.

**Power Base**: Trade is their blood. Alliances their armor. They speak every language, honor every god that proves profitable, and learn quickly which beliefs bend reality and which shatter it.

**Capital**: A vast metropolis grown upward as much as outward. Floating villas drift above marble avenues. Flying ships crowd the sky, carrying diplomats, smugglers, and scholars in equal measure.

**Achievement**: For the first time, elven councils and dwarven halls speak of a human nation not as a curiosity—but as a force that will last.

**Culture**: Freedom to worship, bargain, or betray themselves for profit or principle.

## 4. The Pirates of the Thousand Kingdoms
**Currency**: Pirate Kings Treasure ($PKT)
**Region**: Isles of a Thousand Kingdoms (archipelago north of Tern)

The pirates were never one people, and that is their strength.

They sail everything from patched sailboats held together by tar and prayer to vast, off-world vessels humming with technologies no one on Tasern fully understands. Some crews were born to the sea. Others fell into it—exiles, refugees, failed gods' servants, and travelers who missed their way home and found something better.

**Influence**: Every island learned to bargain, hide, or burn because pirates exist. Trade routes bend around their habits. Kings rise by hiring them and fall by underestimating them.

**Trade**: Stolen goods. Smuggled beliefs—ideas, forbidden myths, outlawed prayers carried shore to shore until they take root somewhere new. Relics from dead worlds. Weapons forged beyond existence. Maps that lead nowhere twice.

**Unity**: None. No banner unites them. No code binds them. Alliances form and shatter with the tides.

**Philosophy**: Motion. An unwillingness to remain where the world tries to trap them.

## 5. Igypt, City of Fear and Vigil
**Currency**: Igypt Gold Sovereign ($IGS)
**Region**: Isolated desert (weeks of travel in every direction)

Igypt rose where fear learned discipline.

The desert stretches empty and unbroken in every direction—a deliberate isolation enforced by heat, sand, and belief. Travelers arrive exhausted, watched, and already afraid. In Igypt, fear is not weakness. It is sacred. It sharpens the mind, humbles the arrogant, and reminds mortals that eternity is not guaranteed.

**The Vigilant Dead**: Honored undead—leaders, generals, scholars who willingly surrendered their promised heavens to remain. Through ritual and sacrifice, they bound themselves to service, protecting families and ideals across generations. They do not rot. They do not hunger. They endure.

**The Hunted**: Twisted undead that fled judgment, refusing damnation only to prolong cruelty. Entire orders exist solely to destroy them.

**Architecture**: Towers of stone and gold rise above necropolises older than most nations.

---

## 6. The Dragons of Tasern
**Currency**: Dragon Hoard Gold ($DHG)
**Region**: Scattered holdings across Tasern

The dragons were never united, and they had never needed to be.

Divided by color, by clan, by ancient grudges remembered longer than most civilizations existed. Each dragon that reaches adulthood carries the strength of a nation in its bones. Their presence bends trade routes, alters weather, reshapes borders without a command spoken.

**Immortality**: Dragons possess no natural end. They do not wither or fade. As long as they find enough food—livestock, monsters, tribute, or worse—they can live forever. Hunger, not age, is the only threat.

**Governance**: Most dragon-held realms are administered by mortals who handle laws while the dragon sleeps, watches, or wanders. Tribute is paid with careful regularity. When it is not, the reminder is unmistakable.

**Truth**: Dragons maintain their own creation myth, crediting their gods with shaping the material plane—a point of contention with elven tradition.

---

## 7. The Orks of Orklin
**Currency**: Orklin Gold Coin ($OGC)
**Region**: Orklin (badlands of black stone, volcanic scars, ash-choked valleys)

The orks no longer wait for war.

Fire and iron have replaced patience. Smoke rises from valleys that once knew only ash and stone. The orks have begun an **industrial revolution**—not for comfort or progress, but for conquest.

**War Machines**: Engines of steel and steam shaped like beasts but stripped of instinct. Iron hides replace flesh. Cannons roar where war-cries once did. These creations do not tire, do not fear, and do not question orders.

**Navy**: Steel steamships cut through seas once ruled by wind and sail. Black-hulled vessels arrive at foreign ports carrying merchants, weapons, or both.

**Philosophy**: Strength remains sacred—but strength has evolved. No longer measured only by muscle and blade, it is now forged in foundries and fed by coal. Victories matter more than honor. Survival more than tradition.

**Threat Level**: The elves watch with dread. The world takes notice. For the first time, Orklin is not merely dangerous. It is *advancing*.

---

## 8. The Druids of the Living Cycle
**Currency**: Button ($BTN) [speculative]
**Region**: Scattered across all lands

The druids do not announce themselves, and that is by design.

They live scattered—in forests, swamps, deserts, coasts, and high stone places—always in quiet alignment with the land they guard. No single circle rules them. No doctrine binds them. What unites druids is balance, not mercy.

**Growth Druids**: Guide forests away from villages, coax rivers into patience, teach farmers when to plant and when to leave soil alone.

**Rot Druids**: When lands grow bloated with people, when cities ignore famine's warnings, when belief twists nature into excess—druids answer with plague, blight, and hunger. These druids are hated, feared, and hunted. They never flee.

**Philosophy**: Stewards of the cycle—growth, decay, death, renewal. In a world near the edge of existence, they ensure nothing lingers too long.
